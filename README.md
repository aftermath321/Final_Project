# Final_Project
This project is made as a final workshop for CodersLab bootcamp, it's based on Spring Boot and Hibernate. It might include other technologies and languages in the future.

The general idea is having an website with Users and admins, who can create recipes, diet plans. All recipes will be rated in spiciness, divided into categories based on cusine.
I might include diet table for each recipe and plan. I also plan to include searching for a recipe basing on what users type in the search field (e.g. user types he has eggs, butter
and bread, so the website will automatically seach for recipes he can do with these ingredients).

This project uses:
-Java
-Spring Boot
-Spring Hiberante
-Spring Security
-Thymeleaf
-HTML
